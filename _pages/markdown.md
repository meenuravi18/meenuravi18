## Organizing Literature

- After trying the plethora of apps and tools out there from Notion to Obsidian, I was reacquainted with my affinity for pen and paper.  
  I have designed a [Research Journal](https://www.amazon.com/Research-Journal-Meenu-Ravi/dp/B0F9VCTLGV) for collecting, organizing, and taking notes on literature review.  
  When I was using online tools/apps, I would often mindlessly copy-paste notes or screenshots. I wasn't truly learning the material and it became perfunctory.  
  Writing my notes, especially in a limited amount of space, helps me focus on what’s important, distill the main points, and improve understanding.

- Zotero is great for building a literature repository. It integrates easily with Overleaf for quick citations.

## Writing

- Overleaf is fantastic for drafting research papers and journal articles, especially with its support for tables, figures, and citations.

- [Mark Leone's (CMU) Blog](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~mleone/how-to.html) offers helpful advice on academic writing, research skills, and career development.

## Research Ideas

- One method I find incredibly helpful for finding research topics and ideas is to write everything down!  
  Writing and reflecting often reveals new ideas—methods, algorithms, or novel directions.  
  Keeping a record of meetings, papers read, and your own thoughts provides a clear view of how your thinking has evolved.  
  It's also invaluable when drafting papers—you can retrieve insights you didn’t realize you'd need.

- Ideas can come from anywhere—movies, books, podcasts—so I keep a notebook with me to track them all.
