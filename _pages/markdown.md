## Organizing Literature

- After trying the plethora of apps and tools out there from Notion to Obsidian, I was reacquainted with my affinity for pen and paper.  
  I have designed a [Research Journal](https://www.amazon.com/Research-Journal-Meenu-Ravi/dp/B0F9VCTLGV) for collecting, organizing, and taking notes on literature review.  
  When I was using online tools/apps, I would often mindlessly copy-paste notes or screenshots. I wasn't truly learning the material and it became perfunctory.  
  Writing my notes, especially in a limited amount of space, helps me focus on what’s important, distill the main points, and improve understanding.

- Zotero is great for building a literature repository. It integrates easily with Overleaf for quick citations.

## Writing

- Overleaf is fantastic for drafting research papers and journal articles, especially with its support for tables, figures, and citations.

- [Mark Leone's (CMU) Blog](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~mleone/how-to.html) offers helpful advice on academic writing, research skills, and career development.

## Research Ideas and Miscellaneous

- One method I find very helpful for finding research topics and ideas is to write everything down!  
  Writing and reflecting often reveals new ideas—methods, algorithms, or novel directions.  
  Keeping a record of meetings, papers read, and your own thoughts provides a clear view of how your thinking has evolved.  
  It's also invaluable when drafting papers—you can retrieve insights you didn’t realize you'd need.
- After each class, paper, or event I participate in, I like to reflect upon it. This can include committee feedback on papers, what I learned in class, new concepts I encountered, my opinions on a talk, and questions that come to mind. In the past I have fallen victim to mindlessly taking courses with the goal of completion, and while that is important, I have found that reflecting on the activities I participate in allows me to practice gratitude and gain a high-level understanding of each experience in relation to my long-term goals.

## Favorite Media (Not specific to research- just in general)
