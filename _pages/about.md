I am a data scientist at The MITRE corporation in McLean, VA. I am currently a Ph.D. student at Virginia Tech, where I am studying computer science. My research interests are in NLP, particularly information extraction, knowledge graphs, and machine learning with applications in environmental and geosciences.
